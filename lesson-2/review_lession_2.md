# React Lesson 2 Notes
- A React component is a reusable UI unit built with JavaScript that returns JSX to describe what should appear on screen.
- Components can be composed together using custom tags (e.g., `<ChatInput />`), but they ultimately render standard HTML elements to the DOM.
- In the chatbot project we created two main components: `ChatInput` for the form and `ChatMessage` for displaying each message bubble.
- Props (properties) let us pass data into components so they can be reused with different values.
- We practiced object/array destructuring to pull fields out of props, and used the logical AND (`&&`) operator for conditional rendering in JSX.
- Refactoring and organizing the code made the component tree easier to read and maintain.
- The `App` component serves as the root of the React app and is the entry point we render into the root DOM node.
